# RealTimeTrafficSignDetectionRecogition
Detect traffic Sign in real time using image processing techniques likes MSER and recognition performed through applying two techniques:
1. MultiLayer Perceptron
2. Random Forest
This repositry contains two readme files:
1. README.txt - This contains data on the usage of the model to make final predictions.
2. readme_training - contains details on how the model was trained with the two techniques, the classifiers that were created and the details on the preprocessing performed before feeding the images to the model.
